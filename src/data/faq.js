        answer: "A low-gain screen (≤1.0 gain) provides wide viewing angles, uniform brightness, and accurate colors, making it ideal for controlled lighting environments like home theaters and conference rooms. It helps reduce glare from high-lumen projectors (3000+ Lumens) and works well with UST projectors, especially when paired with ALR technology for better image quality."

        question: "What are the benefits of a high-gain screen?",
        answer: "A high-gain projection screen increases brightness, making images more vivid and enhancing visibility in ambient light. It improves perceived contrast, ensuring deeper blacks and more vibrant colors. Ideal for large venues or home theaters, it allows for lower-lumen projectors, reducing power consumption and extending lamp life. By directing more light toward the audience, it delivers a more immersive viewing experience."
