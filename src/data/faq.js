        question: "What is the ideal aspect ratio for a home theater projector screen?",
        answer: "A 16:9 aspect ratio is the standard for most modern movies and TV shows, ensuring compatibility with most projectors.",

        question: "Does Lumina Screens offer different gain options?",
        answer: "Yes, We provide a variety of screen gain options tailored for different lighting conditions and viewing preferences.",

        question: "When should I use a low-gain screen?",
        answer: "A low-gain screen (≤1.0 gain) provides wide viewing angles, uniform brightness, and accurate colors, making it ideal for controlled lighting environments like home theaters and conference rooms. It helps reduce glare from high-lumen projectors (3000+ Lumens) and works well with UST projectors, especially when paired with ALR technology for better image quality.",

        question: "What are the benefits of a high-gain screen?",
        answer: "A high-gain projection screen increases brightness, making images more vivid and enhancing visibility in ambient light. It improves perceived contrast, ensuring deeper blacks and more vibrant colors. Ideal for large venues or home theaters, it allows for lower-lumen projectors, reducing power consumption and extending lamp life. By directing more light toward the audience, it delivers a more immersive viewing experience.",

        question: "How do I choose the right screen gain for my home theater?",
        answer: "Screen gain affects brightness and viewing angles. Higher gain (>1.0) boosts brightness but narrows angles, while lower gain (<1.0) improves uniformity. Low-brightness projectors (<2,000 lumens) need 1.3 - 1.5 gain, while high-brightness projectors (>2,000 lumens) work best with 1.0 or lower to avoid glare. Dark rooms suit 1.0 or lower, while ambient light requires 1.3+ or ALR screens. Wide seating needs lower gain, while narrow seating can use higher gain. UST projectors need 0.6 - 0.8 gain ALR screens. For balance, matte white 1.0 gain is a safe choice.",

    {
        question: "What is screen gain in projection screens?",
        answer: "Screen gain measures how much a projection screen amplifies brightness compared to a standard matte white surface (gain of 1.0). A higher gain (1.3+) reflects more light toward the audience, making the image brighter but reducing viewing angles and potentially causing hot-spotting. A lower gain (0.8 - 1.0) offers wider viewing angles, better contrast, and reduced glare, making it ideal for dark home theaters. High-gain screens are best for rooms with ambient light, while low-gain screens work well for controlled lighting and wide seating arrangements. The right gain depends on brightness needs, viewing angles, and room conditions.",
