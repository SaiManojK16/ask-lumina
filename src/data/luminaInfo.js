  ourJourney: `
    In the late 1980s, the rise of VHS cassette players led to numerous cinema closures in India, prompting us to diversify into smaller screens for military and institutional use. 
    Our commitment to quality has earned us a strong reputation in the home theatre industry. The early 1990s marked our expansion into the international market with the export of cinema screens. 
    By 2007, we had moved to a larger facility exclusively focused on manufacturing cinema screens. Despite facing challenges from cheaper Chinese products and increased competition, we persevered, prioritising the production and sale of high-quality cinema screens.
    By 2017, Galalite had established itself as a leader in the Cinema Screen market. Recognizing the tastes of Indian consumers who valued high-quality AV projection screens, we introduced Home Theatre Screens under a fresh brand image, Lumina, leveraging the strong reputation and expertise of Galalite.
